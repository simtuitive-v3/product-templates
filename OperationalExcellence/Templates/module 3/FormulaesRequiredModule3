Productivity Delta Caculation --
Time/Resource/Day -- From Property File
Productivity Percent -- User Input Or From Property File
Workload Time -- Calculated using (Workload X Time Taken At Desk)
True Staffing Required = WorkLoad / (Time/Resource/Day / Time Taken at Desk) = ROUND( 200/(480/8)) = 3

Revised Time/Resource/Day = Time/Resource/day X Productivity Percent = 480 X 0.8 = 384
Work Load Time = Workload X Time Taken At Desk Of Document Verficiation = 200 X 8 = 1600

Productivity Delta = Workload Time / Revised Time/Resource/Day = 1600/384 - 3 = 1.6666666

Utilization Delta = Similar Calculation = 1600/384 - 3 = 1.6666666

Resource Required = True Staffing Required + ROUND (Productivity Delta) + ROUND (Utilization Delta) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5

Man Power Cost Monthly --->
(Resource Required DV + FU + RSU + P + V) X cost_per_hour_per_resource X Work Hour Per Day X Working Days Per Month = 41 X 18 X 8 X 21 

Revenue Total = WL X Revenue 6 Sigma = 50 X 200

Man Power Cost Monthly % Of Revenue Terms = (Man Power Cost Monthly / Revenue Total ) X 100 = 59 %
